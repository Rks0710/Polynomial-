# Polynomial-This project allows an user to put in two polynomials which can be either added, multiplied and evaluated given x number.
# For example, User is required to provide a txt file which contains a polynomial in this form:
  # Ex: (Where five is the coefficient and 4 is the degree: 5x^4 + 2x^3 + 1x^3)
  #     5 4 
  #     2 3 
  #     1 3 
# User is asked to provide a similar txt file containing a polynomial to add, multiply or evaluate.
